RMG Features
************

* **Automatic reaction generation.** RMG will generate reactions of one or two reactant species using 22 reaction family templates, e.g. H abstraction, beta-scission, etc.

* **Extensible databases.** The RMG databases are constructed in a dictionary-tree-library set to allow for easy extension as new data become available.

* **Rapid thermodynamics estimation using group additivity**. Group additivity based on Benson's groups provide fast and reliable thermochemistry estimates.

* **Dynamic simulation in a variety of reactors.** This is acheived via connection to Cantera. Conversion and time targets can be specified.

* **Rate-based mechanism enlargement.** Reactions are added to the mechanism based on their rate, fastest first.

* **Advanced tolerance controls.** Multiple tolerances allow for easy control of the mechanism size.

* **Scriptable, modular interface.** The RMG source code is designed to interface well with Python.
