The ``rmg.unirxn.msc`` Module
*****************************

.. module:: rmg.unirxn.msc

This module contains functions that use the modified strong collision (MSC) approximation to estimate the phenomenological rate coefficients for a unimolecular reaction network. The MSC method is actually a combination of two approximations:

- The collision model of the full master equation is abandoned in favor of a simpler model
  in which the only significant collisions are deactivating. The frequency of these strong collisions is modified by a collision efficiency.

- High-energy grains are approximated as existing in pseudo-steady state.

Applying the MSC method requires designation of an isomer or product channel as the *entrant* state and neglecting all reassociation of other product channels. This results in a linear system of algebraic equations of size :math:`N_\mathrm{isom} \times N_\mathrm{isom}` to be solved at each active energy (that is, energy above the lowest activation barrier). Solving these systems gives, after a final manipulation, the phenomenological rate coefficients from the entrant isomer/channel to all other isomers and product channels in the network. Repeating this procedure using each isomer/channel as the entrant state gives all of the phenomenological rates in the system.

Of the approximate master equation methods implemented, this is the most robust, and is the fallback when other approximate methods are unsuccessful. However, it is also usually the least accurate of the methods due to the nature of the approximations utilized.
