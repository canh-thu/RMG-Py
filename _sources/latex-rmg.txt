*********************************
RMG-Py v\ |release| documentation
*********************************

RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator 
that constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction 
steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. This documentation is for the newer Python version of RMG that we call RMG-Py.

CanTherm is developed and distributed as part of RMG-Py, but can be used as a stand-alone
application for Thermochemistry, Transition State Theory, and Master Equation chemical kinetics
calculations. Its user guide is also included.

The last section of this documentation covers some of the more in depth theory behind
RMG and CanTherm.

Please visit http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/
for the most up to date documentation and source code. You may refer to the separate *RMG-Py API Reference*
document to view the details of RMG-Py's modules and subpackages.
