Parsing Output Files
********************

The syntax of CanTherm output files closely mirrors that of the input files.
For each ``thermo()`` function in the input file, there will be a corresponding
``thermo()`` function in the output file containing the computed thermodynamic
model. Similarly, For each ``kinetics()`` function in the input file, there will 
be a corresponding ``kinetics()`` function in the output file containing the
computed kinetics model.

The ``examples`` directory contains both CanTherm input files and the resulting
output files.
