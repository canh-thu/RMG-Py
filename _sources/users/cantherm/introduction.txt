**CanTherm** is a tool for computing the thermodynamic properties of chemical
species and high-pressure-limit rate coefficients for chemical reactions using
the results of a quantum chemistry calculation. Thermodynamic properties are
computed using the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation with optional
corrections for hindered internal rotors. Kinetic parameters are computed using
canonical transition state theory with optional tunneling correction.
