********************
MacOS X Installation
********************

There are a number of dependencies for RMG-Py. This page will guide you through installing them.
You will need the Command Line Tools for XCode. We highly recommend the `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ package manager.
The following instructions assume that you have `installed Homebrew and its requirements <http://brew.sh>`_.
We recommend using a `Virtual Environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_ for your Python packages,
but this is optional (without it you may need to add `sudo` before some commands to solve permission errors).

You will also need gfortran, Python, Numpy and Scipy. We typically install them using 
`homebrew-python <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-python>`_  but other methods may work as well. For example::

	brew tap homebrew/python
	brew install numpy
	brew install scipy
	brew install matplotlib --with-cairo --with-ghostscript --with-ticl-tk --with-pyqt --with-pygtk --withgtk3

* Install git if you don't already have it (you may also like some graphical interfaces like `mxcl's GitX <https://github.com/mxcl/gitx/downloads>`_ or `GitHub for Mac <http://mac.github.com/>`_)::

	brew update
	brew install git

* Make a directory to put everything in::

	mkdir ~/Code

* Get the RMG-Py source code from GitHub::

	cd ~/Code
	git clone https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-database.git
	git clone https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Py.git

* Install the Python dependencies listed in the :file:`RMG-Py/requirements.txt` file using `pip` (do ``easy_install pip`` if you don't already have it)::

	pip install -r RMG-Py/requirements.txt

* Get and build `PyDQED <https://github.com/GreenGroup/PyDQED>`_::

	cd ~/Code
	git clone https://github.com/GreenGroup/PyDQED.git
	cd PyDQED
	export LIBRARY_PATH=$(dirname $(gfortran -print-file-name=libgfortran.a))
	make
	make install

* Get and build `PyDAS <https://github.com/GreenGroup/PyDAS>`_::

	cd ~/Code
	git clone https://github.com/GreenGroup/PyDAS.git
	cd PyDAS
	export LIBRARY_PATH=$(dirname $(gfortran -print-file-name=libgfortran.a))
	make
	make install

* Get the RMG-Database and get and build RMG-Py::

	cd ~/Code
	git clone git@github.com:GreenGroup/RMG-database.git
	git clone git@github.com:GreenGroup/RMG-Py.git
	cd RMG-Py
	make

* Install `RDKit <http://www.rdkit.org>`_::

	brew tap rdkit/rdkit
	brew install rdkit --with-inchi
	brew link --overwrite rdkit

  You'll need various environment variables set, eg. put this in your `~/.bash_profile` file::
	
	export RDBASE=/usr/local/share/RDKit

* Run an example: ::

	cd ~/Code/RMG-Py/
	python rmg.py examples/rmg/minimal/input.py

  Verify your installation by opening the resulting output.html file under the "examples/rmg/minimal" directory.
  
  You can also use the Makefile targets to test and run examples: ::

	make test
	make eg1
	make eg2

To run with on-the-fly Quantum Mechanics calculations, you will also need 
`MOPAC <http://openmopac.net/downloads.html>`_ or Gaussian.
