<span id="guidelines"></span><h1>13. Guidelines for Building a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines-for-building-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>RMG has been designed to build kinetic models for gas phase pyrolysis and combustion of
organic molecules made of C, H, O and S. By kinetic model, we mean a set
of reactions and associated kinetics that represent the chemical transformations
occurring in the system of interest. These systems could be the combustion of fuels,
pyrolysis of hydrocarbon feedstocks, etc. The total number of reactions and species
typically required to describe some of these processes can run into the thousands making
these models difficult and error-prone to build manually. This is the main motivation
behind using software like RMG that build such models automatically in a systematic
reproducible manner.</p>
<p>In RMG, the user is expected to provide an input file specifying the conditions
(temperature, pressure, etc.) under which one desires to develop kinetic models.
The following are some tips for setting up your input/condition file.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-with-a-good-seed-mechanism">
<h2>13.1. Start with a good seed mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#start-with-a-good-seed-mechanism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>RMG is a useful tool in elucidating important pathways in a given process but may not
capture certain special reaction types which may be specific to the system you are
interested in. However, if you already have a good idea of these reactions that are
important and are not available in the standard RMG library, you can create a
‘seed mechanism’  and include it in the input file to RMG. This will directly
include these in the model core and add other reactions from the RMG library on
top of it using our rate based algorithm. (Similarly, you can specify your own
thermodynamic parameters for species using thermochemistry libraries which are similar
in concept to seed mechanisms. In order to build these libraries, you will need to
specify all species in the RMG adjacency list format.) In a combustion system, RMG
tends to do a decent job filling in the termination and propagation steps of a mechanism
if it is guided with the initiation and chain branching steps using a seed mechanism.
Ideally, RMG should be able to find all the right chemistry through our kinetics
database but holes in current kinetic databases can make this task difficult. A
good seed mechanism can address this issue for the system of interest and also
reduce the size, cost and time taken to arrive at a converged model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-the-right-termination-criterion">
<h2>13.2. Setting up the right termination criterion<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-the-right-termination-criterion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Start with a relatively large tolerance (such as 0.1) when building your first model
to make sure that RMG can converge the model to completion without any hiccups, then
begin tightening the tolerance if you are able to converge the initial model.  For
large molecules such as tetradecane (C14), even a tolerance of 0.1 may be too tight
for RMG to work with and lead to convergence problems. Note that a good seed mechanism
allows for faster convergence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restricting-the-number-of-carbon-atoms-oxygen-atoms-and-radical-sites-per-species">
<h2>13.3. Restricting the number of carbon atoms, oxygen atoms, and radical sites per species<a class="headerlink" href="#restricting-the-number-of-carbon-atoms-oxygen-atoms-and-radical-sites-per-species" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Options to tune the maximum number of carbon or oxygen atoms, or number of radical
sites per species can be specified at the beginning of the condition file. In most
systems, we do not expect large contributions from species with more than 1 radical
center (i.e. biradicals, etc.) to affect the overall chemistry, thus it may be useful
to limit the maximum number of radicals to 2 (to allow for O2). The same applies for
the maximum number of oxygens you want to allow per species. Restricting the number
of carbon atoms in each species may also be worthwhile to prevent very large molecules
from being generated if many such species appear in your model.  Using any of these
options requires some prior knowledge of the chemistry in your system. It is
recommended that an initial model be generated without turning these options on.
If many unlikely species show up in your model (or if your model has trouble
converging and is generating many unlikely species on the edge), you can begin
tuning these options to produce a better model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-key-species-into-the-initial-condition-file">
<h2>13.4. Adding key species into the initial condition file<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-key-species-into-the-initial-condition-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, chain branching reactions like dissociation of ROOH species do not make
it to the core directly because if their fluxes are very small and the tolerance is
not tight enough. In these cases, seeding the condition file with these species
(with zero concentration) is helpful. By adding these species to the initial set
of species in the condition file, the reactions involving those species will be
automatically added to the core. (Putting these reactions in the seed mechanism
has the same effect.)  Thus, if a species is known to be a part of your system
and RMG is having trouble incorporating it within your model, it should be added
to the condition file with 0.0 set as the concentration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-with-a-single-molecule-when-generating-a-model-for-a-mixture">
<h2>13.5. Starting with a single molecule when generating a model for a mixture<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-a-single-molecule-when-generating-a-model-for-a-mixture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For modeling the combustion of fuel mixtures, you may want to start with determining
their composition and starting with a kinetic study of the dominant compound. It is
possible to model the combustion of fuel mixtures but they are more challenging as
well as harder to converge in RMG because RMG will automatically generate all cross
reactions between the reacting species and intermedites. Starting with single species
is always a good idea and is also useful when thinking about fuel mixtures. In order
to build a better background in chemical kinetic model development and validation,
please look at a recent paper from our group on butanol combustion available
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218010001586">here</a>.
This should give you some idea about how RMG can be put to use for the species
of interest to you.</p>
